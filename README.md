# ncmcover

Download netease music covers fast.

Installation:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arom1a/ncmcover.git
cargo install --path ncmcover
```

Usage:

```text
ncmcover <download path>
```

Example:

```text
$ ncmcover /Users/aromia/Downloads
> input the url here: https://music.163.com/song?id=1381706151
```

then, the cover of the song (or the album to be exact) will be downloaded to the path provided.

I suggest using an alias in zshrc so that the path won't be typed every time.
